# TurboBasicSolarSystemSimulator
old Borland TurboBasic Gravity Soalr System simulator for historical reference Just for those who never saw the Old Borland TurboBasic which was realy the first widepsread compiled basic available for the PC in 1987-88. I wrote this then. It does some interesting things like: let you vary the gravity force live via a joystick the standard gravity interaction iteration lets you specify a range of planet size and number of sun as well as asteroids that the randon generator will then use for the range of possibilities for each planet class. to decrease cpu this had one class of object called asteroids which were affected by all other larger bodies but their own gravity effect was not used to compute the others thus eliminating the exponential calculation problem when you had a lot of asteroids.
